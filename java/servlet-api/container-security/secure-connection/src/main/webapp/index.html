<p style="font-style: italic;">
    Before running this sample you need:<br>
    a. configure key-store; it is java platform mechanism for managing keys and certificates; Start by adding self
    signed certificate: <br>
    keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA<br>
    This command should create .keystore file in user home directory; afterwards tomcat will look this file to find
    certificates.<br>
    In production you typically import certificate signed by certificate authority<br>
    b. modify tomcat server.xml configuration by removing comments around https section. Tomcat will automatically load
    certificate if
    transport quarantee is set to confidential.
